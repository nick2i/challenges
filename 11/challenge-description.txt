Our next programming challenge is to programmatically create an image with the following properties:
* the *image contains a square*
* the *square contains a circle*

The image can be generated in whatever format you like, so long as it is reasonably easy to view. This includes e.g. HTML canvases, image files, an SVG file, etc. A couple examples are shown below

ASCII art (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) is not allowed.

In particular, if you are interested in working with an image file manually (versus using an image library), the PPM, PGM, and PBM formats are quite accessible. Their wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm#Description) contains a basic example of each as well as a description of the format. These formats are much simpler (and much less space-efficient) than compression-based formats such as PNG or JPEG.

For extra credit:
* the square and circle should be different, non-grayscale colors of your choice

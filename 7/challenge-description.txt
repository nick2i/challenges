Challenge

Write the natural sort algorithm.  Consider a file manager with files with embedded numbers.   For example:

```
contract-july 1.docx
contract-july 11.docx
contract-july 2.docx
```

The above list is lexicographically sorted (e.g. naive string sort) however most humans would say that it is out of order and "july 11" is after "july 2".  The natural sort algorithm is the preferred sort for these sorts of strings which respects numbers in strings and sorts them in their numerical order even with-out zero padding.

Hint: I believe there is a pretty decisive "aha moment" in understanding this algorithm.  However, even after that to write the algorithm well probably will push you into some details about your language of choice which may not feel entirely intuitive.

Test examples

```
["v1.9", "v1.10", "v1.2", "v1.21", "v1.11", "v1.3"]

["Chapter 1", "Chapter 10", "Chapter 2", "Chapter 11", "Chapter 20", "Chapter 3"]

["192.168.1.1", "192.168.1.10", "192.168.1.2", "192.168.1.20", "192.168.1.3"]

["file1.txt", "file10.txt", "file2.txt", "file20.txt", "file11.txt", "file3.txt"]

["estimate-all-history-counts.xlsx", "estimate-cost-price-helper-sheet.xlsx", "estimate-stats(1).xlsx", "estimate-stats.xlsx"]
```

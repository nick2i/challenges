*The Monty Hall Problem*

---

There is a special game show hosted by Monty Hall, with three closed doors, labeled #1, #2, and #3. The game show is described by the following five steps:

1. Monty Hall randomly selects one of the three doors and puts a prize behind it. The other two doors hide nothing.
2. A contestant, who does not know where the prize is, selects one of the three doors. This door is not opened yet.
3. Monty chooses one of the three doors and opens it. The door that Monty opens (a) does not hide the prize, and (b) is not the door that the contestant selected. If there are more than one such doors, Monty randomly selects one or the other.
4. There are now only two closed doors, the one the contestant selected in step 2, and one they didn't select. The contestant decides whether to keep their original choice, or to switch to the other closed door.
5. The contestant wins if the door they selected in step 4 is the same as the one Monty put a prize behind in step 1.

*Challenge:*

A contestant's strategy is given by their choices in steps 2 and 4. Write a program to determine the success rate of a contestant's strategy by simulating the game 1000 times and calculating the fraction of the times the contestant wins. Determine the success rate for these two contestants:

*Shawn* chooses door #1 in step 2, and always sticks with door #1 in step 4.
*John* chooses door #1 in step 2, and always switches to the other closed door in step 4.

*Bonus:*

Find success rates for these other contestants:

*Jeff* chooses randomly from the available options in both step 2 and step 4.
*Joel* chooses randomly in step 2, and always sticks with his door in step 4.
*Nick* chooses randomly in step 2, and always switches in step 4.
*Dan* chooses door #1 in step 2, and switches to door #2 if available in step 4. If door #2 is not available because it was opened, then he stays with door #1.
*Shawn H.* always uses either Shawn (M.)'s or John's strategy. He remembers whether his previous strategy worked and changes it accordingly. On his first game, he uses Shawn (M.)'s strategy. Thereafter, if he won the previous game, he sticks with the same strategy as the previous game. If he lost the previous game, then he switches (Shawn (M.) to John or John to Shawn (M.)).
